**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING**
I am using Google's Maps JavaScript API for the heatmap in this artefact, for this I am using Google's free tier of their API platform **this will _expire_ on _08/08/2025_**
after this has expired you will have to **replace the API key with your own Google API Key** in order for EcoEquity to work as intended

Please contact me on _thomas2.lynn@live.uwe.ac.uk_ if you need help replacing the API key or creating an API key
